## Virginia's Rappahannock River Potential Oyster Restoration Site Survey

Data Submission Pending: NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office

The idea is to take my side scan sonar orthomosaics and the intensity range groundtruthed with sediment cores and to update a few unsurveyed spots of the Bay-wide Habitat Map

The final steps are geo-referencing the orthoimages and building up the attribute tables to reflect the [CMECS](https://iocm.noaa.gov/cmecs/) standard.
