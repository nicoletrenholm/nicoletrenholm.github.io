## Virginia's Rappahannock River Potential Oyster Restoration Site Survey 2014

Data Submission Pending: NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office final polygon attribution and orthoimage georeferencing

The idea is to take my side scan sonar orthomosaics and the intensity range groundtruthed with sediment cores and to update a few unsurveyed spots of the Bay-wide Habitat Map. The data was served  up in Caris software and google Earth but without the final touches from a little effort in GIS. Now I will wrap up the data preperation in qGIS for the next Bay-wide Habitat Map refresh.

The final steps are geo-referencing the orthoimages and building up the attribute tables to reflect the [CMECS](https://iocm.noaa.gov/cmecs/) standard.

Virginia water bodies historic oyster private and public state boundaries are observed by VIMS and Virginia Marine Resource Commission.

[These VIMS Restoration Atlas Maps](http://www.vims.edu/research/units/labgroups/molluscan_ecology/restoration/va_restoration_atlas/rappahannock_punchbowl/index.php)
display potential oyster restoration locations and a few of those locations correspond with the oyster habitat survey in 2014.
