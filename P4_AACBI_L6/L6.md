This is Lab 6. A lab meant to demonstrate the use of Geoda with a dataset to expierament with varying forms of spatial auto-correlation GUIs.

Instead of looking at Guerry region data I focused on a dataset to help me prepare in one of my final projects.

I wanted to assess the clustering, significance distribution and Moran's I Local value for a dataset that relays the health siginificance associatd wtih Maryland sub-watersheds. Good thing the Moran's I values overall are projected as positive towards healthier watersheds.
Though the watersheds I am paying most attention to didi not have a close spatial correlation nor any significant clustering.
