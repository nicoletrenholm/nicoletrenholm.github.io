# P4 AACBI_L6

This is Lab 6. A lab meant to demonstrate the use of Geoda with dataset to expierament with varying forms of spatial auto-correlation Guis.

Instead of looking at Guerry data I focused on a dataset to help me prepare in one of my final projects.

I wanted to assess the clustering, significance distribution and Moran's I Local value for a dataset that relays the health siginificance associatd wtih Maryland sub-watersheds.
