# Final Project Tasks:

My final project is to improve project presentation on Project 1-7 hosted on Nicole's Github Portfolio Page.
All projects are intended to become living project locations for related projects to be updated as new
data is available and analysis is needed.

Here, I list the near and long-term improvements planned for Project 1 and 2. Projects 1 & 2 were submitted earlier in the class. The short-term improvements will be accomplished before the end of this course.
There are 3 new Projects I added as final projects that are in development. I will develop their Github project pages and early data map drafts and work up these locations as my projects evolve throughout my graduate work.

## Project 1: P1_SLR

Short-term Goal: Get my 2.5D Baltimore Sea Level Rise Property Impact.pdf.pdf to appear on the Project Page.
Long-term Goal: To add follow-up up Maps of Annapolis, Norfolk and D.C at 10 and 21 feet seal level rise and nautical chart versions.

## Project 2: P2_Glacier

Short-term Goal: Update Glacier giffy from 2D to 3D.
Long-term Goal: Test out other software for point cloud 3D attribute display manipulation in glacial fjords. Develop the place for the code for data processing of ocean-glacial in situ and remote sensing data analysis throughout graduate work.

## Project 3: P3_STEMAA
Short-term Goal: A STEM Middle School Group and I develop a coastal marine debris pollution zone and cleanup priority spots map. The focus is the Severn and South River watershed.
 This map is being developed in phases. A project plan is in development with a basic reconnaissance map project description included. Steps in the preparation of this map are included.
Long-term Goal:
 This map can be updated once more cleanup locations are identified and other datasets are more available. Also developing priority information for private locations may be reviewed in addition to pubic land.
## Project 4: P4_AACBI_L6
Short-term Goal: This is Lab 6 in disguise. Here, I applied the Guerry data analysis but focused on MD state sub-watershed and watershed Combined Biotic Index (CBI) values relative to stream health. I wanted to have a sense of the CBI value of the watersheds in which I am mentoring the STEM middle school group in community map building associated with 2 watersheds of interest. Apparently, the watersheds I am focusing on with the students are not very significant in CBI value extremities.
Long-term Goal:
I plan to become more familiar with Geoda variations of auto-correlation as I consider what analysis I may need to apply in my graduate work data analysis.
## Project 5: P5_VAHabMap
Short-term Goal:
I need to develop attribute tables associated with my digitized various habitat map files in the survey locations of the Rappahannock River. All files must be in CMECS NCBO classification standards.
Long-term Goal:
I need to geotag three side scan mosaic surveys. I need to also create sediment grab sample point location files that have attribution. All files must be in CMECS NCBO classification standards.
Note: There is no Project 6 at this point but I could not figure out how to rename my
project 7 folder in Github to 6 so I will change that once I do.
## Project 7: P7_FishFinder
Short-term Goal:
A screenshot of the latest real time data of current active Fish Finder Program. Background project data and description. A map plan for consolidating Fish Finder monitoring cruise locations
Long-term Goal:
This map is being developed in phases. A project plan is in development with a basic reconnaissance map project description included. Steps in the preparation of this map are included.
